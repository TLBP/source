<appendix id="pylib-reporting-bugs">
  <title>B. Reporting Bugs</title>
<para>Python is a mature programming language which has established a
reputation for stability. In order to maintain this reputation, the
developers would like to know of any deficiencies you find in
Python or its documentation.</para>
<para>Before submitting a report, you will be required to log into
SourceForge; this will make it possible for the developers to
contact you for additional information if needed. It is not
possible to submit a bug report anonymously.</para>
<para>All bug reports should be submitted via the Python Bug Tracker
on SourceForge (<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=5470"/>).
The bug tracker offers a Web form which allows pertinent
information to be entered and submitted to the developers.</para>
<para>The first step in filing a report is to determine whether the
problem has already been reported. The advantage in doing so, aside
from saving the developers time, is that you learn what has been
done to fix it; it may be that the problem has already been fixed
for the next release, or additional information is needed (in which
case you are welcome to provide it if you can!). To do this, search
the bug database using the search box on the left side of the
page.</para>
<para>If the problem you're reporting is not already in the bug
tracker, go back to the Python Bug Tracker (<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=5470"/>).
Select the ``Submit a Bug'' link at the top of the page to open the
bug reporting form.</para>
<para>The submission form has a number of fields. The only fields that
are required are the ``Summary'' and ``Details'' fields. For the
summary, enter a <emphasis>very</emphasis> short description of the problem;
less than ten words is good. In the Details field, describe the
problem in detail, including what you expected to happen and what
did happen. Be sure to include the version of Python you used,
whether any extension modules were involved, and what hardware and
software platform you were using (including version information as
appropriate).</para>
<para>The only other field that you may want to set is the
``Category'' field, which allows you to place the bug report into a
broad category (such as ``Documentation'' or ``Library'').</para>
<para>Each bug report will be assigned to a developer who will
determine what needs to be done to correct the problem. You will
receive an update each time action is taken on the bug.</para>

  <title>C. History and License</title>
  <sect1 id="pylib-node951">
    <title>C.1 History of the software</title>
<para>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at
Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see <ulink url="http://www.cwi.nl/"/>) in the Netherlands as
a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from
others.</para>
<para>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation
for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see <ulink url="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/"/>)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.</para>
<para>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the
same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation; see <ulink url="http://www.zope.com/"/>). In 2001, the
Python Software Foundation (PSF, see <ulink url="http://www.python.org/psf/"/>) was
formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own
Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a
sponsoring member of the PSF.</para>
<para>All Python releases are Open Source (see <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/"/> for the
Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.</para>

<note><para> GPL-compatible
doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL. All
Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified
version without making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible
licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software
that is released under the GPL; the others don't.</para>

  Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

  This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
  text is available at
        http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
  The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
  (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
  any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
  copyrighted.

  The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
  &lt;ghost@aladdin.com&gt;.  Other authors are noted in the change history
  that follows (in reverse chronological order):

  2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
        references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
        now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
  1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
  1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
        added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
        Purschke &lt;purschke@bnl.gov&gt;.
  1999-05-03 lpd Original version.
